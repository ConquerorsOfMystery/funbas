IDEA: MAKE A GAME LIKE PAPERCLIP SIMULATOR, BUT WITH MORE
GRAPHICS/PHYSICS

Zany story, simulation game where the excitement comes from
seeing catchy taglines, maybe some pretty things, and "number big".

I especially like the idea of having visualized battles or "growth"
of some kind which the player can appreciate.

IDEA 1- EMPIRE SIMULATOR

Pseudo-realistic (i.e. not) government simulator. You play a king
who runs a government from his castle.

IDEA 2- AI WARS

Play as different AI-powered empires of bad guys who all war
against each other.

IDEA 3- BEE SIMULATOR

Play as a beehive or ant colony or something. Make new colonies.

IDEA 4- MATH SIMULATOR?

Vague, fuzz idea that you could use real self-modifying code to
explore mathematics.

?? - HOW DO WE DO "NUMBER BIG" - ??

Solution 1: Just use 64 bit integers? Perhaps those are big enough.

Solution 2: Use a bignum implementation? All it needs to do is
addition and multiplication, no division.

Solution 3: 128 bit, maybe 256 bit integers?


I think I want to make a nation state simulator or an AI simulator game... I want some
sort of fun automata stuff that feels sort of like redstone in minecraft (like, you can
program it).

An automata-oriented empire game. Hmmm....
