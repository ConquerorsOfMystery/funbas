I WANT TO MAKE A VIDEO GAME

Description and desired qualities:
* Open world, Exploration
* Sandbox
* Top-down 3D
* Easy controls, should be simple enough to work with a Genesis Controller
(D-pad + ABC + Start or arrows + ZXC + Enter)
* Simple but interesting graphics, emphasis on "unusual effects" over
detailed art
* Level editor
* Simple combat and controls- ?Turn Based?
