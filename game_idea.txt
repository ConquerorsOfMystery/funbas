I WANT TO MAKE A VIDEO GAME

Description and desired qualities:
* Open world, Exploration
* Sandbox
* Top-down 3D
* Easy controls, should be simple enough to work with a Genesis Controller
(D-pad + ABC + Start or arrows + ZXC + Enter)
* Simple but interesting graphics, emphasis on "unusual effects" over
detailed art
* Level editor
* Simple combat and controls- ?Turn Based?
* Graphics that revolve around interesting/wondrous visuals, pretty stuff
* Entertaining Story

ARCHITECTURE
* Seabass as programming language using Funbas library
* OpenGL 1.1 graphics OR raytraced. Flat-colored spheres and boxes with simple shadows.
* CPU texture effects for BGs
* Textured text
* Simple AABB/Sphere based Physics engine, simple colliders
* Entities use sphere colliders usually
* Levels are 3D but built to be functionally 2D

GAMEPLAY
* Super-monkey-ball-esque abstract exploration/adventure
* Strategy > Reflexes, I don't think I want turn-based interaction but I want it to be a puzzle
* "Good guy" gameplay is heavily rewarded, the game should incentivize behaving like what Christ told us to do,
"Love one another even as I have loved you" rather than something like Skyrim or GTA which will have you "win" being
a thief. Hopefully it would actually train this behavior.
